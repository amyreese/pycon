# Friendly and Modern AsyncIO

This repository provides a set of example code for using
AsyncIO in Python 3.7, and building friendly APIs and tools
on top of popular open source libraries.

AsyncIO is a powerful mechanism for building high-performance services,
but it has long been thought of as “too complicated”. But it’s easier
than you might think, and with Python 3.7, it’s easier than ever to get
started using just the standard library! We'll cover the basics of AsyncIO,
take a look at the latest features in 3.7, build friendly and expressive
APIs, analyze best practices for third-party libraries, and discuss
integrating async code with synchronous libraries and codebases.


## Setup

Be sure to have Python 3.7 installed and available in your
shell of choice.  If you don't already, I recommend using
[pyenv][] to manage and install multiple versions of Python.

From your favorite working directory, the following commands
will clone this repository, create a virtualenv, and install
a set of common libraries for AsyncIO from PyPI.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/amyreese/pycon
$ cd pycon/friendly-asyncio
$ python3.7 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```
